WARNING: This is a playful sandbox and anything could happen.

This is FreeCAD code to generate the parts for a MendelMax. At present this is VERY incomplete, but it is a work in 
progress. If you just want to print a MendelMax, your best bet for now is to use the STL's from Thingiverse.

To install, download the files and copy the entire install (omitting the build directory if you wish) to your FreeCAD 
Macro Directory (Defined on the Macro tab of the FreeCAD preferences). The files should remain in their existing folders.
Once installed, launch FreeCAD (You may need to relaunch if it is running already).


Once you install it, see this tutorial for instructions on how to run the script: http://mendelmax.com/tikiwiki/tiki-index.php?page=Getting+Started+with+FreeCAD+scripting

Edit the script MendelMax.pyas necessary to change the variables and run it to build the model.

See http://www.MendelMax.com for full details.
